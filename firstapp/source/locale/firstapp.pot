msgid ""
"`Micro-services <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices>`_ are an "
"important design pattern that helps achieve application modularity. "
"Separating logical application functions into independent services "
"simplifies maintenance and re-use. Decoupling components also makes it "
"easier to selectively scale individual components, as required. Further, "
"application modularity is a required feature of applications that scale out "
"well and are fault tolerant."

msgid "Scalability"
msgstr ""

#: ../introduction.rst:57
msgid ""
"Cloud applications often use many small instances rather than a few large "
"instances. Provided that an application is sufficiently modular, you can "
"easily distribute micro-services across as many instances as required. This "
"architecture enables an application to grow past the limit imposed by the "
"maximum size of an instance. It is like trying to move a large number of "
"people from one place to another; there is only so many people you can put "
"on the largest bus, but you can use an unlimited number of buses or small "
"cars, which provide just the capacity you need - and no more."

"In cloud programming, there is a well-known analogy known as \"cattle vs pets"
"\". If you have not heard it before, it goes like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../introduction.rst:72
msgid ""
"When you deal with pets, you name and care for them. If they get sick, you "
"nurse them back to health, which can be difficult and very time consuming. "
"When you deal with cattle, you attach a numbered tag to their ear. If they "
"get sick, you put them down and move on."
msgstr ""

#: ../introduction.rst:77
msgid ""
"That, as it happens, is the new reality of programming. Applications and "
"systems used to be created on large, expensive servers, cared for by "
"operations staff dedicated to keeping them healthy. If something went wrong "
"with one of those servers, the staff's job was to do whatever it took to "
"make it right again and save the server and the application."
msgstr ""

#: ../introduction.rst:84
msgid ""
"In cloud programming, it is very different. Rather than large, expensive "
"servers, you have virtual machines that are disposable; if something goes "
"wrong, you shut the server down and spin up a new one. There is still "
"operations staff, but rather than nursing individual servers back to health, "
"their job is to monitor the health of the overall system."

"As with classical infrastructure, failures of the underpinning cloud "
